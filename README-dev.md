## Development TODOs

- readme: how to close sheets. sheets hide when game loses focus.

- sheets in windows become gradually bigger when draging them?!

- do the callbacks need `${id}`?

- does the approach of a single timer (from the first loaded entity) do funky stuff with timestop?s

- package.json: "type": "module" refactor.

- duration string: implemented in 2 places. merge into a service.
